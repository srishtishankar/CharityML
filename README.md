# CharityML


1	Project Brief
In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help Charity (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

2	Software Required
•	Python 2.7 (Anaconda) 
•	NumPy
•	Pandas
•	scikit-learn
•	matplotlib

3	Procedure
•	Download the census dataset from the UCI Repository
•	Explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded
•	Apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format
•	Evaluate several supervised learning algorithms on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution
•	Optimize the model selected and present it as the solution
•	Explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see how well it's performing when considering the data isn’t given.
